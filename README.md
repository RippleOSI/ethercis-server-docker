# EtherCIS Server

Dockerfile and customisation for the [EtherCIS Server](http://ethercis.org/)
Requires the EtherCIS DB to work

The two Docker images are packaged as separate repositories in order to enable Automated Builds on Docker Hub

Use Docker Compose from [here](https://github.com/RippleOSI/Ripple-Stack-Vagrant-Docker) to run the two containers side by side
